# deep_learning_challenge

The purpose of this analysis was to create a neural network model which could predict the success of non-profit startup organizations, to assist the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup in deciding which business ventures to provide funding to. Data from over 34000 past business ventures were used to create and train the model.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:


-   Targets: 

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
